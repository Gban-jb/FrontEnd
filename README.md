## Suggested learning path

1. Day1 — Learn the HTML building blocks: headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, forms.
2. Day2 — Add important details: meta tags, accessibility, HTML5 features, and validation.
3. Day3 — Learn CSS step by step using `day3/day3css.html` (selectors, box model, layout, responsive design).
4. Projects — Apply what you learned in `Projects/`. Start with `multi-page-website.html`.

## About `day3/day3css.html`

This page is a big CSS reference with many short examples. It’s designed so you can:

- See a concept, like “margin” or “flexbox”, and a small demo next to it
- Change a value and immediately see the effect
- Compare layout methods (flexbox vs grid) in one place

Tips:

- Try changing colors, spacing, and font sizes
- Switch `display` types (block, inline, flex, grid) and see how the layout changes
- Resize the browser window to see responsive behavior

## About `Projects/multi-page-website.html`

This file shows a simple, modern website layout with:

- A header and navigation bar
- A hero section (big headline and button)
- Services/About/Contact sections
- A responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop

What to try:

- Change the text and images to your own content
- Add or remove sections
- Adjust spacing, colors, and fonts to match your style

## Common questions

- Do I need to install anything?
  - No. You can just open `.html` files in your browser. A local server is optional.

- Can I break something?
  - Not really. If something looks wrong, undo your change or pull the latest copy again.

- How do I learn faster?
  - Read a small section, change a few values, and refresh the page. Repetition helps a lot.
